# Firmware Repository for Legacy MacBooks

This project contains a collection of firmware files aimed at older MacBook models, especially the **MacBook Pro 13" Mid 2009**. The initiative was born out of the need to install Linux distributions (such as **Kali Linux**) on hardware that faces compatibility issues with modern drivers.  
*(It has not been tested on newer MacBook models. If any volunteers wish to test and report results, feel free to do so for potential future updates and improvements.)*

## 🔧 Contents

- Wi-Fi, audio, and video firmware

> ⚠️ Note: These files have only been tested on older models (2009). Compatibility with newer models is not guaranteed.

## 💡 Motivation

The entire process was carried out through self-learning, using open-source resources. This experience served as both technical growth and a personal challenge. If you have an old Mac and want to revive it with Linux, this project might help you.
